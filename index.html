            I am an entry-level Full-Stack Developer with skills in Node.js,
            SQL, Python, and AI. My career background spans over a decade in
            external audit, where I provided services for major local and
            international companies. During this time, I gained extensive
            knowledge of SOX requirements, including internal controls, risk
            assessment, and financial statements audit. I was responsible for
            managing engagements under SOX standards for SEC-listed companies,
            while also designing and delivering training programs on compliance
            and audit practices. Passionate about building new tools and
            applying technology to enhance efficiency and productivity, I bring
            a risk-aware and security-focused approach to development. I focus
            on delivering solutions that bridge the gap between business needs
            and technical innovation.
